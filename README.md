# Algorithm / Compiler Research

## Background
I started reading Algorithms (4th edition) by Robert Sedgewick and got the idea to do research into algorithms in different languagesâ€”a somewhat redundant and already well-explored topic. However, I wanted to conduct research that interests me, as a distraction from some of the monotonous tasks assigned to me in my university coursework (some parts of computer science are much less interesting to me).

Building on that idea, I wanted to explore compilers as well because I want to improve my understanding of the more mathematical side of computer science. So, I decided to combine these two topics into a single conceptual paper.

I am currently studying for my BSc in Computer Science as of 2025 and am almost done with my second year (out of three).

## Uses of this Research
Almost non-applicable. I can't quite tell if that statement is self-deprecation, true, or a mix of both.
